{{*expo.gif}}
Come to our Annual Back to School Night! This event (formerly "Curriculum
Night") offers parents/guardians a great chance to meet your student's
teacher, learn about our support services, and __be the first to sign up for
conferences.__ Early conference sign-ups are available this night only. Once
the evening concludes we begin our regular sign-up process.

Schedule:
  * 6:00-6:30 Parents meet with specialists (Sped, ELD, Music, PE in their rooms)
  * 6:30-6:40 Title 1 Annual Meeting: What is our school-wide Title 1 program?  (All parents in Library) The Title 1 presentation will be repeated at 7:50-8:00 in the library
  * 6:30-7:10 All Kindergarten parents: presentations by teachers in their rooms
  * 6:40-7:10 All 1st-2nd parents: presentations by teachers in their rooms.
  * 7:15-7:45 All 3-5 parents: presentations by teachers in their rooms.
  * 7:50-8:00 Title 1 Annual Meeting – same as above (For parents who missed the earlier session, in Library)

Once teachers have completed their sessions they will no longer be in their
rooms. We are sorry, but we are not able to accommodate individualized or
alternative meeting times during this evening’s event.
