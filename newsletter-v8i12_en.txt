==== Bike Safety ====
{{*bike.png}}
Please remember that wearing a helmet is an essential feature to bicycling safety. It is also the law in the state of Oregon for children under 16 yrs old of age. If we notice students riding home without helmets, we will contact parents to bring a helmet to them or arrange for them to get home another way that ensures their safety.

==== Lost and Found Items ==== 
{{*lostfound.png}}
All clothing items in our lost and found as of December 21st will be donated to charity over winter break. Don't let that favorite jacket or scarf get away! Lost items that belong to your child need to be claimed and taken home prior to winter break. We strongly encourage the practice of writing your child's name in their winter clothing.

==== Flouride Varnish and Health Screening ====
We will be doing Flouride Varnish and Health Screening on December 5th
