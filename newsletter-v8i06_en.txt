4J's Safe Routes to School in partnership with the Transportation Department
and Holt is planning a â€œwalking school bus" on Wednesday, Oct 10th.

We invite all students to participate!  Buses will drop off in the church parking lot where students who choose to participate will be met by volunteers and school staff. We'll walk along Calvin Street to school. All Holt students and families that would like to can join the walking group at that point as well. 

We will walk safely in a large, chaperoned "walking school bus" to school. While walkers should arrive at Holt during breakfast time, some may need to eat in the classroom if there are delays. Bused students who choose not to participate will be driven the rest of the way to school on the bus. 

When? **7:20-7:45 AM**.  Where? **1120 President Street** in the church parking lot. See you there!

If you can volunteer to be a chaperone for the walk, please sign up at [[http://signup.com/go/UzPMNRa]]

==== Holtoberfest ====
{{*cornucopia.png}}
Please join us on Friday, October 19th from 6-8 PM for a fun night of games, food, crafts, and activities. 

We're selling tickets to the event starting Monday, Oct 15th before and after school in front by the flagpole. Purchase early so you don't have to wait in line on the night of the event! 

More information is coming home with your students. 

Want to volunteer?? We're looking for people to help us set up/tear down. Contact Deb Stowell if you are willing to provide donations of food, drinks, and bagged candy. If you know of a group that would like to donate their time, please let us know. 

==== Talented and Gifted ====
{{*students.png}}
Many of our students perform well at Holt and our teachers work hard to meet their varying needs. However, if you are often looking for ways to challenge your student, and they perform extremely well on assessments in class, then you may want to consider a TAG referral. Students who are referred will be evaluated to determine if TAG may be an option for them. 

Students will undergo an academic review of classroom and standardized tests, as well as classroom performance. In order to be eligible for a TAG qualification, a student must score at the 97 percentile or above using two measures. Areas for TAG eligibilities are: math, reading, and intellectually gifted (IQ). These qualifications vary somewhat by current grade level. There are two testing windows throughout the school year for this process to occur. A parent may request a referral form from the office or classroom teacher at any point during the school year.
