==== School Fees ====
{{*school-supply.png}}
Each year Holt asks for $25 to cover all school supplies and fees for field trips. Please bring or mail your payment to the Holt front office. Alternatively, you may have students who are able to successfully deliver money bring payment to their teacher in an envelope with your child’s name and “supplies fee” written on the front. If you need to make partial payment or work on a payment plan, we are happy to accommodate you. We accept cash or checks. Holt works hard to make your fees go a long way. We use this money to purchase pencils, binders, erasers, crayons, and other student supplies. When we purchase in bulk we are able to get a lower price than is available in stores. Please help us keep your costs down by turning in your school fees for this school year. We gladly accept donations to help cover students who are not able to pay for their fees.

==== Back To School Night reminder ====
{{*expo.gif}}
Our teachers are looking forward to greeting parents/guardians on Back to School Night, this coming Thursday. Please note that there was a one-time revision for the Kindergarten starting time after the initial flyer went out. Last week’s Quick News had the correct, revised schedule. Here it is again:

  * 6:00-6:30 Parents meet with specialists (Sped, ELD, Music, PE in their rooms)
  * 6:30-6:40 Title 1 Annual Meeting: What is our school-wide Title 1 program? (All parents in Library)
  * The Title 1 presentation will be repeated at 7:50-8:00 in the library
  * 6:30-7:10 All Kindergarten parents: presentations by teachers in their rooms
  * 6:40-7:10 All 1st-2nd parents: presentations by teachers in their rooms.
  * 7:15-7:45 All 3-5 parents: presentations by teachers in their rooms.
  * 7:50-8:00 Title 1 Annual Meeting – same as above (For parents who missed the earlier session, in Library)

Once teachers have completed their sessions they will no longer be in their rooms. We are sorry, but we are not able to accommodate individualized or alternative meeting times during this evening’s event.
