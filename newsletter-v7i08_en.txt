Thanks to our Parent Board and volunteers for hosting a wonderful Holtoberfest. A great time was had by all! Our Holtoberfest is put on entirely by our Holt families. We begin planning nearly a year in advance. If you'd like to work toward a wonderful 2018 Holtoberfest, please join us at our next Parent Board meeting on November 16th. Our meeting will follow the Site Council meeting in the library at 6:30pm.
