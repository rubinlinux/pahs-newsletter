==== Parking ====
{{*noparking.png}}
Please remember that there is no parking on the red curbs at Holt. We
reserve the areas at the front and the side of the school for drop offs. You
can also always drop off at the North Park Church and encourage your students
to cross at the crosswalk with Mrs. Kitterman. She's such an amazing crossing
guard she's been featured in local media.

==== Curriculum/Title 1 Night ====
{{*expo.gif}}
Come to our Annual Curriculum and Title 1 Information Night! It's a great
chance to meet your teacher, learn about our support services, and be the
first to sign up for conferences. Early conference sign ups are available
this night only. Once the evening concludes we begin our regular sign up
process.
