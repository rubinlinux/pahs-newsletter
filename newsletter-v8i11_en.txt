==== Stay Healthy and Help Others ====
{{*sick.png}}
Please remember to keep students home from school until 24 hours after their last bit of fever and/or experience of vomiting and diarrhea. This will help ensure a fuller, more durable recovery and it will also reduce illness within our school. Please remind your kids to direct sneezes and coughs into the crook of their arm, in order to reduce the spread of germs.  

==== Weather Related Closures - Be Prepared ====
{{*snowcar.png}}
Winter weather will arrive eventually. In the event of a weather closure or delay, the decision will be communicated as quickly as possible through local news media, text alert via Twitter, Facebook, and the district website, usually by 6:15 AM. Remember, no news = no change. 

Families are encouraged to subscribe to receive text alerts (send a text message to 40404 saying FOLLOW 4JWEATHER ) to get the news as quickly and easily as possible. Please see [[http://www.4j.lane.edu/weather]] for more information.   

==== Conferences Were Great! ====

Thank you for investing precious time in meeting with your child's teacher during Conferences! We enjoyed connecting with you and we want you to know how much we appreciate your support of teaching and learning at Holt Elementary School. Every staff member was involved in the effort, either meeting directly with parents/guardians or providing a crucial supporting role, such as child care, fees, scheduling, distributing pictures and test results, dinners for staff, and answering questions. 

We were honored and delighted by the delicious luncheon provided by caring parent volunteers on Thursday! It helped to pull us through the second of two long work days. :-) Thank you!

==== Last reminder: PIcture re-takes ====
