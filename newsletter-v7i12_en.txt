==== Snow Day Information ====
{{*snowcar.png}}
When winter weather arrives, schools may be closed or delayed or buses may use snow routes. These decisions are made by the district early in the morning and are the same for every 4J school.

**Snow day notifications:** Our school district communicates any decision to change school or bus schedules as quickly as possible in several ways, all well before 6:30 a.m.

  * Sign up for text-message alerts— text FOLLOW 4JWEATHER to 40404 
  * Like Eugene School District 4J on Facebook, [[http://facebook.com/4Jschools]]
  * Check the district website, [[http://www.4j.lane.edu]]
  * Tune in to local news media 

**No news = No change.** If schools and buses are on their regular schedule, there will NOT be an announcement.

**School schedule**:

  * School Closure = No school for students. Decision about afternoon/evening activities will be made by noon.
  * Two-Hour Delay: School hours will be 10:00-2:10. The cafeteria will open at 9:30am. If there is a late start on a Wednesday we will not end at our regular 1:10pm time. 

**Snow Routes:** Holt does not have alternate “snow routes” that avoid higher
and steeper elevations. If you need information about your student’s bus
route, please see [[http://www.4j.lane.edu/transportation/snowroutes]]. 

**Parent Choice:** Please consider the road conditions in your own area in making your decision about school attendance, and notify the school if your student will be staying home. Parents’ decisions about absences for weather-related safety reasons will be honored.

For more information, please see [[http://www.4j.lane.edu/weather]]. 

Please be aware that individual schools will no longer be using the
auto-dialer or email systems to notify families of 2-hour delays or weather
closures. The only way to find this information is to use the systems above.
