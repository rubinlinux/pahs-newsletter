We'll be joined by some visitors from Sheldon High School and Military Pilots. All retired and active military personnel are invited to drop into our library starting at 8:00 for coffee and donuts.  The National Guard is scheduled to arrive at 9:00am. That said, last time they were delayed by weather for over 90 minutes. So while we will shoot for 9:00, it could be later. Students are encouraged to dress for USA Spirit Day. Your student has been working on learning the Star-Spangled Banner in music with Mr. Walter. Please ask them to sing it for you. The kids are amazing as always!

==== School's Out Friday, June 15th at 11:10am ====

We close on Friday and immediately begin creating next year's Master Schedule. Please check your student's backpack for their final report card.
