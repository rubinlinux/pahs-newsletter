===== Volume 7, Issue 15 =====
==== Spare Clothes ====
{{*clotheson.jpg}}
Please put a change of clothes in your student's backpack. The field is getting bit muddy and we have students slipping and needing to change their clothes. So please make sure your student has a change of clothes at school (pants, socks & undies are the best, we generally have enough shirts to help out). We would like to avoid having to call parents to the school with new clothes.

==== Mod Pizza ====

The Mod Pizza fund-raiser is this Tuesday. Holt will receive a portion of earnings for customers who present the flier. Please take your flier to MOD pizza at any time during the day (Tuesday, January 9th) and show it to the cashier. They are just down Coburg Rd. behind Natural Grocers. Fliers went home on Wednesday of last week and may be in your student's backpack. We have extra fliers in the front office if you need one. 

==== No School Jan 15th ====
