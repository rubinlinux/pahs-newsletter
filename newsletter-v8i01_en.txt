==== Walking and Driving Safely at School ====
{{*crossingguard.png}}
Students are to use great caution when walking or riding their bicycles to school. Use crosswalks with care. Follow directions of adults and stay on sidewalks whenever possible. Crossing guards will be on duty in the morning from 7:25 AM to 7:55 AM and then after school from 2:25 PM to 2:35 p.m (and from 1:10-1:20 on Fridays)

=== Drop Off ===
  * Use the inside (curb) lane ONLY to drop off your child(ren). The outside (non curb)
    lanes are travel thru only. They are not for dropping off or picking up.
  * Once you have dropped off your child from the inside curb lane, carefully pull out into the adjoining outside lane and depart. You can also drop your children at the North park Church (across Harlow) and have your students cross at the Harlow crosswalk with Mrs. Kitterman.
  * Do not leave your vehicle unattended along the curb (yellow or red) at any time as this may interfere with emergency and safety vehicles (and district vehicles).
  * If you need to come into the building, please park your car in a designated parking space in our parking lot, the parking lot behind the N. Park Church and escort your child into the building. You are also free to park on Calvin street, where we request that you please be respectful of mailboxes and driveways.

=== Pick Up ===
  * Students in Grades K-2 are picked up from the sidewalk in front of the building.
  * Students in grades 3-5 are picked up on the sidewalk on the east side of the school building.
  * Please use the inside (curb) lane to pick up your child(ren). 
  * Pull up to the car ahead of you. If you are the first car in line please pull forward to the front of your line.
  * After your child is safely inside the car, slowly pull to the outside lane and proceed to exit the parking lot.
  * Please be courteous to others by picking up your children as soon as they arrive at your vehicle. 
  * In order to safely move traffic through and increase the safety for walkers, riders, and drivers who may be waiting to enter the parking lot from Calvin St., it is important that parents do not use this time to socialize with friends or staff. 
  * REMEMBER not to leave your vehicle unattended at any time as this may interfere with emergency and safety vehicles, as well as district vehicless. If you need to come into the building, please park your car in a designated parking space. 
  * After your child is safely inside the car, slowly pull to the outside lane and proceed to exit the parking lot. 

If you’d like to avoid the parking lot traffic, you may park at North Park Church across Harlow and meet your student there once Mrs. Kitterman has crossed them. We encourage small groups of students to cross and walk together. You can also park on Calvin and meet your students. We have a crossing guard on Calvin St. (right next to the school, not at Calvin and Harlow) who can cross your kids.

FIRST WEEK OF SCHOOL is bound to be very busy. We encourage you to consider the North Park Church and Calvin St. options in order to lessen congestion and make your experience more pleasant. 

On behalf of all of our students, thank you for your attention to safety. 

Sincerely, 
Dan Sterling
Principal
