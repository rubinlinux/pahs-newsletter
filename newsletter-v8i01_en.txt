==== Walking and Driving Safely at School ====
{{*crossingguard.png}}
Please remind your students to be careful when walking or riding to school. Crossing guards are on
duty 30 minutes before school, and 10 minutes after school.

If you drive your students to/from school, remember that the inside (curb) lane is
the ONLY lane to drop off & pick up students, and that
you MUST NOT leave your vehicle. If you need to go inside, or stop to
socialize, please be considerate to other families & park your vehicle.

Extra parking is available in the parking lot at North Park Church, or along
Calvin street (But, please respect driveways and mailboxes). If you'd like to
avoid the parking lot traffic, drop off at the Church and Mrs. Kitterman  will
cross your students safely.

Pick-Up Locations:
  * Grades K-2: Sidewalk in front of the building.
  * grades 3-5: Sidewalk on the east side of the school building (parallel to Calvin St.)

**The first week of school is bound to be very busy**. We encourage you to consider the North Park Church and Calvin St. options in order to lessen congestion and make your experience more pleasant.
