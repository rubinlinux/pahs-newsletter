==== The Jog-A-Thon is Here! ====
{{*holtbolt.png}}
Join us for the Holt Bolt this Friday! Come watch your student run to raise
money for our school. This is our primary fundraiser for the year. We use the
money raised to provide field trips and enrichment opportunities for the
students. 

The parking lot closes at 8:00 for set up. If you drop off your
student at or after 8am, they will need to be dropped off on Calvin and cross
the parking lot. 

We run rain or shine. It's a great idea to pack an extra
outfit in the event we run in the rain. See you Friday!

  * Grades K, 4 & 5 run from 8:30-9:30am
  * Grades 1, 2 & 3 run from 10-11am
