===== Volume 7 Issue 6 =====

==== Conference Sign-Ups ====
Please check this week's Monday Mailer for your Conference Sign Up or
Conference Confirmation Sheet. If you signed up for a time during
Curriculum/Title 1 Informational Night, you have an orange Confirmation Form.
Please sign the bottom and return it with your child.

If you have not yet signed up, please use the yellow sign up sheet and select
your top 4 choices. Conferences are scheduled on a first come, first served
basis so the more quickly you return your form, the more likely you are to get
one of your preferred times. 

If we are not able to accommodate any of your
preferred times, someone from the office will call you and work to find a time
you can attend. We will do our best to schedule siblings together.

==== Safety Week ====
This week is Safety Week at Holt. Each day we will practice a new drill. By
the end of the week our goal is that our students know what to do in any
emergency situation. The ALICE Drill will take place on Tuesday, with training
in classrooms beginning on Monday. If you have any questions about Safety
Week, please call the front office and ask to speak with Ms. Joyce or Mrs.
Page.
