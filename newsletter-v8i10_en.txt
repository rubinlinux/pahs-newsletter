==== School Pictures and Retakes ====
{{*pixday.gif}}
School pictures are distributed at Conferences. We do not send them home due
to the high number of pictures damages in student backpacks. Please swing by
the Welcome Desk during Conferences either before or after you conference to
pick up your pictures. Retakes will be on November 14th.

==== School Fees Reminder ====
{{*school-supply.png}}
Each year Holt requests $25 to cover all school supplies and help defray the
cost of field trips. Thank you for your contributions. At present, we are
experiencing a deficit with respect to recovered costs, as payment is still
needed from a significant percentage of our families. For your convenience, we
will be accepting fees at the Welcome Table during Conferences. If you would
prefer to make a partial payment or create a payment plan, one of our
administrators will be happy to work with you. We accept cash or checks. 

Holt works hard to make your fees go a long way! We use them to purchase binders, pencils, erasers, crayons, and numerous other student supplies.  Staff supplies, by the way, are paid for out of our school budget, not your supply fee. When we purchase in bulk, we are able to get a lower price than is typically available in retail stores. We gratefully accept donations to help families who are currently not able to fully pay their fees. 

==== Child Care during Conferences ====
{{*meet-teacher.png}}
We will have childcare available in the Holt Library during Conferences. While
we will try and accommodate younger children, we are not able to assist with
babies and toddlers. Stop by the Welcome Desk and we'll be happy to set up
your child with an activity so you can have some individual time with your
teacher.
