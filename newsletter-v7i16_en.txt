==== Kindergarten Meet & Greet and Registration ====
Do you have an incoming Kindergarten student beginning next year? Our annual Kindergarten Meet & Greet is set for Wednesday, February 21st from 6-7pm. Families are encouraged to bring their future Kindergarten students! The students will spend time in the classrooms and take a fun bus ride around the block. Parents will meet in the library and get all the information they need for the upcoming year. We will have registration packets for the 2018-2019 school year available. A small gift will be provided to all enrolling families in attendance (supplies limited).

==== Bing Night ====
Join us this Friday for Bingo Night. We have lots of great prizes and will have free popcorn for all in attendance. Drinks will be available for purchase and offset the cost of the event. Bingo runs from 6:30-8pm. Please enter through the gym/cafeteria doors.

==== All Visitors to Holt must have a visible badge at all times ====
We want to remind everyone that all visitors and volunteers need to have a visible badge and sign in and out each time they visit. If you would like to stay for breakfast or hang out in the gym, please make sure you sign in. 

The goodbye spot is the gray carpet area between the gym and cafeteria. No badge is needed to say goodbye in that spot. You MUST sign in and out if you want to walk your student to class. All goodbyes need to take place in the hallway please. Our goal is to start classes on time and long goodbyes can impact our ability to do that. If you'd like to volunteer or visit the classroom, please make arrangements ahead of time with your teacher.
