{{*meet-teacher.png}}
Don't forget to sign up for Parent Conferences taking place Nov. 7th and 8th!
This is a great opportunity to meet with your child's teacher to share information and
set goals. Papers will be coming home soon! Conferences are on Wednesday,
November 7 after school and into the evening and on Thursday, November 8,
starting in the morning and going into the evening. Sign up sheets coming home
will allow you to sign up for your times that work best for you. If you signed
up in your child's classroom during Back to School Night, you're all set.

Remember, there will be no school for students on November 8 and 9.

==== Walk & Roll Day ====
{{*bike.png}}
Some experts recommend that kids get a minimum of 60 minutes of physical
activity every day. Physical activity is often in competition for screen time,
including video games, these days. Walking, rolling, and biking to school can
help improve strength and endurance, decrease anxiety and stress, and help
maintain a healthy weight. Please consider joining us & fellow students from
around the district by participating in the Walk & Roll Day on Wednesday, October 10th.
Information on how you can participate in this great event will be coming
home.
