==== Parking Reminder ====
{{*dropoff.png}}
Please remember that there is no parking in the drop off lane at the front of the school. 
You may only park in marked spots. This also includes the curb area along the west fence and planter. 
That is a fire lane, and is marked by a sign. Parking or stopping there also makes is very 
difficult for larger cars to turn the corner. If you are getting out of your car for even
a minute, we do need you to park in a marked stall. 

We have several families appropriately using the disabled spots. Please do not park in a
disabled spot unless you have an appropriate parking permit issued by the DMV. Please make
sure this sign is visible in your window. Thank you for helping us with the congestion in
the front lot!
