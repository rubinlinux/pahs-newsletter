This week is staff appreciation week. We want to thank the amazing Holt staff
for all they do. If you would like to drop off treats for the staff, please
bring them by the office. Our Parent Board always has a few special thank yous
for them. If you call the front office, they are happy to connect you with one
of our Parent Board members if you'd like more information.

Our annual Parent Party is scheduled for Thursday, May 10th at 6:00pm. Child
care and dinner is provided for all attending. This is the annual meeting
where we gather your feedback on our events this year and hold our elections
for next year's Parent Board. We hope you can come join us! We'll have games
and a movie for the kids. 

==== Thank You SMART Readers ====

A huge thank you to our SMART readers. We value all of our community members
who come in on Tuesdays and Thursdays to read with our students in grades K-2.
We are so thrilled to be part of this program. See you next year SMART
volunteers. We truly adore you!

==== Middle School Math Pathways Meeting Thursday, May 10th ====
{{*mathfun.png}}
Letâ€™s talk about math! Current and future middle school parents are invited
to a Math Pathways Information Night on Thursday, May 10 at the 4j Education
Center.

Please join us to learn about middle school math placement and pathways to
advanced math in high school, get answers to your questions, and share your
thoughts. 4J schools are establishing a consistent math pacing and placement
process in middle school to improve clarity, equity and access to accelerated
math learning opportunities. Students will have multiple pathways to access
upper-level math courses in high school, such as pre-calculus, calculus and
statistics. 

==== Walk & Bike To School Event Wednesday, May 9th ====
{{*bike.png}}
Join us for our first ever school-wide Walk & Bike to school event. We'll be
joined by Mayor Vinis and other District guests for this special event. Our
school buses will drop off students at 1155 President Street, on the Calvin
side parking lot of the LDS Church. It would be fabulous if everyone who
generally drops off their children at Holt could join us and drop off here. We'll
have supervision beginning at 7:25. Students will travel to school in walking
school buses. All who walk, bike, or roll will be entered into a special
raffle that includes wonderful prizes. We'll have a short assembly in the gym
following the fun event. If you have questions or want to volunteer, please
call the Holt front office.
