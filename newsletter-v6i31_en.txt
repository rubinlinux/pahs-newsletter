It's getting hot outside. For safety reasons please remember that all
shoes need to have a back. Please know that our bark chips can be
sharp if your student is wearing sandals. That said, sandals are fine,
but flip flops without a back are not safe on the playground. We have
a limited number of loaner shoes if your student forgets appropriate
shoes.

{{*skateworld.png}}
We've earned the whole school Skateworld party on June 5th. Permission
slips will be coming home in the Monday mailer. Please include names
of all family members attending. Due to the number of students at
Holt, this party is for Holt students and their immediate family only.
We do not have room to accommodate any friends who do not attend the
school.

Please Note, we must have a permission slip before the day of the
event. There will be a sign in at the front door. We need your name on
it before the evening of the event.
