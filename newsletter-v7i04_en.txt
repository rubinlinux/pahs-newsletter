From time to time we partner with local businesses to have a 'Holt Night' where
a percentage of Holt supporters' purchases go toward field trips, ipads, and 
enrichment activities for our students.

Friday October 6th is Holt night at both Chipotle locations. Bring the flyer from your 
Monday Mailer, or just tell the cashier you are there to support Holt. Extra flyers are
available in the office.
