Thanks to all for another successful fundraiser! We brought in over
$26,000. The students earned the Skate World party this Monday from
6-8pm. All students attending need to have a permission slip on file.
If you need another, please call the front office. Given the number of
students at Holt ,we only have room for immediate family members. We
look forward to enjoying our special night at Skate World with you and
your family.

student's Monday Mailer for additional information. If you have any
questions, please call the front office (541-790-6100).

==== Toys at School ====
{{*spinner.png}}
Please remember that toys don't have a place at school. They create a
distraction in the classroom and often become a source of conflict on
the playground. We ask that everyone please leave toys at home.
Spinners are not permitted at school during any time.
