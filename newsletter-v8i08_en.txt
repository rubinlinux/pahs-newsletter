==== Holtoberfest Was Wonderful ====
{{*goodjob.png}}
Thank you to our volunteers from PAHS, (Holt's parent organization), and our
Staff for producing a spectacular Holtoberfest last Friday night! Hundreds of
families joined in on the fun! 

If you'd like to help with next year's Holtoberfest event, please contact PAHS or Deb Stowell. 

==== PAHS General Meeting ====
{{*parentgroup.png}}
PAHS, our parent involvement/volunteer group, will be having a 
General Meeting for all parents/guardians this Thursday, starting at 6:00 PM.

We're hoping many of you will join us, as we will have students
presenting as part of the evening's agenda. 

This is a great time to come and see what we are all about, and
what you can do to get involved with our amazing parent organization! 

==== Conferences coming up ====
{{*meet-teacher.png}}
Parent Teacher Conferences are coming up on November 8th and 9th.
If you haven't yet signed up with your students' teacher for Conferences,
please contact them to do so. Alternatively, you may call the office at
541-790-6100. As always, there will be no school on Thursday and Friday of
that week. 

==== Costumes ====
{{*spacegirl.png}}
We had some amazing costumes at Holtoberfest last week! Our new families
may be wondering whether dressing up during the school day on Halloween is
appropriate or not. While we know that many kids love getting into costume,
our school's tradition is that we do not encourage students to wear costumes
during the school day.
