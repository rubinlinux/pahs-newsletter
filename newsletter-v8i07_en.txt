==== Cyberbullying ====
{{*technology.png}}
Holt's school rules: Be Safe, Respectful, Responsible, and Kind, are good
rules to live by--not just during the school day, but every day 24/7.
Unfortunately, sometimes kids do not remember to guide their actions with
those rules, and that leads to hurt. Nowadays, technology can facilitate a
different kind of disrespect, and in some cases result in bullying. It's
called cyberbullying, and it happens when someone uses electronic devices to
defame, intimidate, harass, insult, or otherwise hurt another person.
Communications of this sort that substantially disrupts or prevents a safe and
positive educational environment may be considered as cyberbullying. It's not
okay, and it can lead to school disciplinary measures.

Here are some tips for parents and educators to help prevent cyberbullying:

  * Establish that all rules for interacting with people in real life also apply for interacting online or through cell phones.
  * Model appropriate technology usage.
  * Monitor young people's activities while they are online or engaged in
   social media.
  * Use filtering and blocking software as part of a comprehensive approach to online safety.
  * Consider creating a "technology use contract" with your child that leads to consequences at home if the contract's provisions are breached.
  * Teach and frequently reinforce positive values about how others are to be treated with respect and with dignity.

The most important messages a child sees and hears each day reside in their
heart. These messages help shape their attitudes about themselves and
others. Cyber-awareness can go a long way towards reducing targeted
negative messaging. Positive reinforcement of positive values works hand in
hand with awareness to create conditions of success for kids at home, in
the neighborhood, and at school.
