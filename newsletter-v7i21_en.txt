Calling all future kindergarten students:

Come join us this Wednesday, February 21st at 6pm for our kindergarten orientation and registration. Please bring your future kindergartener. They will meet the teachers, do a fun craft, and even take a short bus ride. Parents will be in the library. We'll introduce you to our Administration and our Secretary who processes all registrations. This is your opportunity to ask questions and help your student get ready for an exciting year. Please don't be late. The bus will leave with the kinders shortly after we begin.

Our Cultural Heritage Night is coming on May 16th. We're hoping that students and families will sign up for a table where you can share information about your heritage. If you are interested in creating a presentation, please see Ms. Darla as soon as possible. We've had students share customs, religious celebrations and beliefs, and information about their country of origin. If students are in need of ideas, we're happy to help them identify great things to share. The student and family tables are our absolute favorite!
