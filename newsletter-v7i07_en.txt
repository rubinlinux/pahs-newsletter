Holtoberfest is this Friday, October 27th from 6-8pm. Tickets will be on sale before and after school this week. Please check your Monday Mailer for information on ticket prices.

Costumes **are** welcome at Holtoberfest, but we do not wear costumes to school on either the 27th or 31st. Please make sure costumes are safe to play in, do not contain weapons, do not completely cover the face, and are not offensive to others. Costumes should be family friendly. Please remember that our families bring very young children to this event. We want everyone to have fun!

==== Spirit Day ====

Friday, October 27th is Pajama Day. Each month we have a spirit day where students can dress up. Our amazing Student Council has chosen a wide range of fun days this year. Please join us in wearing your pajamas to school this Friday.

==== Halloween ====

Holt doesn't engage in the celebration of holidays. We do engage students in studying them as part of the early elementary experience. We respectfully ask that students refrain from wearing costumes to school. They present a significant distraction. We attempt to have fun and limit distractions by offering up one Spirit Day per month where kids can celebrate and dress up. This Friday we are offering Pajama Day. We truly hope you will join us in dressing up for this event.

You are welcome and encouraged to wear your Halloween Costume to Holtoberfest if this is a holiday your celebrate. Holtoberfest is Fall themed, so if you don't celebrate Halloween there is no need to wear costumes.

==== Lost & Found ====

Please check out the Lost and Found at Holtoberfest. Our Lost and Found is overflowing. We'll have it in the library that evening for parents to look through.
