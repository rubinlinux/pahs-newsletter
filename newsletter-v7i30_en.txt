==== Holt Bolt (Jog-A-Thon) Update ====
{{*holtbolt.png}}
A big thanks to all of our sponsors and volunteers for another amazing Holt
Bolt! You can find the names of our generous sponsors on the back of your
child's shirt. A super big thank you to Ablertson's on Coburg Road for
donating the water for the event. Another big Thank You to our amazing O
Heroes! We had quite a few volunteers from the Oregon Football Team come
support our event. Puddles was also on hand for some fun.

By now you've heard that the first round of runners (K, 4 & 5) were called
inside early due to lightening. They were able to run for exactly 30 minutes
(1/2 of what they should). We've projected what they could have done on the
forms coming home. We doubled what they had completed in the first 30 minutes.
We were very fortunate that the Oregon Ducks were able to shift inside with us
and pass out Otter Pops in the classrooms. It was a super fun day for all!

We will begin accepting your donation envelopes now. All must be signed or they will be
sent home for a parent signature.
