==== Spanish Speaker/Writer Needed ==== 
{{*hola.png}}
Quicknews may be without a Spanish version until mid-May.

We are looking for a Spanish Speaker/Writer to assist with Parent Board Activities.
Our amazing Veronica Saldana has her youngest child moving on to Grade 5. We are
looking for another Holt parent to join her both this year and next in
providing Spanish translation, leadership and assistance for our Parent Board
activities. 

If you feel comfortable speaking and writing in Spanish, please contact
Joyce in the front office (541-790-6100). We'll create a long runway where we will
all work together to ease into Veronica's Board Position. Our Parent Board is a fun
group who meet monthly to consider fundraising, family events, and how to increase
communication. Veronica translates the Parent-generated Quick News each week,
working closely with Principal Joyce to communicate upcoming events. This is a key
role we really need filled. Veronica is taking a month off from writing the Spanish
Quicknews, so we would love to begin to ease you in sooner than later.

==== Walk & Bike to School Event ====
{{*bike.png}}
May 9th is District-Wide Walk & Bike to School! All bus riders will participate!

As you know, Holt has worked closely with Safe Routes to School this year to
increase safe walking and biking. We are currently working with the District
to provide all bus riders with the ability to participate in the May event. 

All school buses will drop off students on May 9th down the street from the school
at 1155 President Street (Actually their parking lot on Calvin street).
This will have our students walking approximately 1/4 mile. It's a super short
walk that will enable the whole school to participate in the event.
Staff will then be on hand to offer "walking school buses", that will walk together
to the school. Bust route times will pick up as usual. 

The walking school bus will only apply to the morning bus. 

All students who walk these last few blocks can then participate in the amazing
 drawings and give-aways that our walk, bike and rolling friends have enjoyed
 all year. This is going to be a ton of fun. If you are interested in assisting
 with this event, please call Joyce or Lavinia in the front office. We will be
 stationing staff and parents along all crosswalks to help our students.
