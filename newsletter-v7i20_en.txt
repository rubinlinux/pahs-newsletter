{{*vaccine.png}}
February 21st is Oregon's Exclusion Day. Any student without current shot
records on file will be excluded from school. Our health clerk, Denise, has
reached out to all families who have not yet turned in their shot records.
Please work with her on getting everything we need so your child doesn't miss
any school. We truly do not want to exclude anyone.

==== Holt Technology/Cell Phone Policy ====

Please remember that cell phones, electronic devices, and toys are not
permitted at school during school hours. Our annual newsletter details the
policy regarding these items.

==== Sock Hop ====

The Holt Sock Hop is next Wednesday, February 14th. We'd love to have you come
join us at school. Please contact your teacher for the time your student will be
dancing.

==== Holidays and Celebrations ====
{{*socks.png}}
At Holt, we do not engage in celebrations that are not directly tied to our
curriculum. We also follow the 4j Wellness Policy with regards to the
distribution of food and snacks. 

The celebration of Valentine's Day is not
part of our curriculum or course of study at Holt. We are not able to
distribute any candy, cupcakes, or cookies to our students. The only foods
that can be shared or included in classroom activities are those meeting the
Healthy Snacks and Parties Guidelines. We have copies of these guidelines in
the front office. We will be spending February 14th dancing at our Sock Hop.

If you are able, we are collecting socks for First Place Family Shelter as
part of this event. In honor of our namesake, Bertha Holt, we spend a great
deal of time talking about service to others, kindness, and compassion. These
are values included in our Social Skills curriculum. We truly hope you will
join us in this important celebration that has been part of our school for
many years.
