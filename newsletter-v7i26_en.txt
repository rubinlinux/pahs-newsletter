School resumes Tuesday, April 2nd. We hope you had a wonderful Spring Break. 

==== Field Trips ====
{{*schoolbus.png}}
As we head into Spring many classes plan field trips. If you would like to
help chaperone a field trip, we need a current background check on file.
Background checks usually take 2 weeks to process. Please don't save this for
the last minute. We've had to tell far too many folks that they are not able
to chaperone because they have let their background checks expire. Background
checks are valid for two years. If you need a current check please go to
[[http://www.helpcounter.net/eugene]] to fill one out. These are school specific. You
must choose all schools you wish to volunteer at when you go to this site. If
your student is in Grade 5, please consider checking both Holt and Monroe so
you will be good to go when your child gets there.
