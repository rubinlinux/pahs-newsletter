==== Picture Day ====
{{*pixday.gif}}
Smile! Picture Day is tomorrow: Wednesday, September 26. Please complete your
order form and send back to school with your payment.

Don't worry if Picture Day is catching you at a tight financial time. You can always order your school photos later in the year.

All students will have their picture taken on Picture Day for our Student Information System. It is very important that we have current photos of all students in case of emergency.

==== Crossing Guard Volunteers Needed ====
{{*crossingguard.png}}
We are looking for a few people to volunteer for crossing guard/parking
monitors in the drop off lanes in the mornings. Our current guards need to
start meeting with students and are no longer available to do the amazing job
they have been doing! This is a very important volunteer position that helps
keep our kids and our school safe. If several people agree to help, each
volunteer would only be needed once or twice a week. If you are interested
please contact the office.  

==== Walk & Roll to School Challenge ====
{{*bike.png}}
Holt Elementary School is participating in the October Walk+Roll to School
Challenge and we need your help! The Walk+Roll to School Challenge is a
month-long event in which students are encouraged to use active transportation
to and from school. Our goal is to encourage as many students as possible to
increase their physical activity by walking, biking, scooting, skating, etc.
This year we have great incentives and prizes to encourage our students to get
active! You'll be hearing more about this in days to come!
