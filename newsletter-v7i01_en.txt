Greetings Holt families, we'd like to introduce you to this, the Holt Quick News! 

Quick News is produced by PAHS, your Parent Board, in conjunction with Holt. 
We strive to publish weekly. If you have information you'd like us to include, please let our PAHS board or Principal Joyce know. 

We need a full week's notice to include information and we often have a backlog of topics.
Welcome Back!

==== First Week Parking ====
{{*noparking.png}}
We know that families like to walk their students in on the first day, so if you would like to do this, 
please remember that North Park Church across the street has graciously offered their parking lot for 
use by our families. We do not have sufficient parking at Holt to accommodate parent parking. Families may
not park in the //Pause// parking in front or on the side of the school. Please allow extra time during
the first week for street parking or parking across the street at North Park Church.

==== Pick Up ====

Students in Grades K-2 are picked up in front of the school. Families need to
be in //Pause// parking near the curb or park and meet your teacher at their pick up spot in grades K-2.
The inside lanes in front of the school __must keep moving__. We'd like to suggest you park at North Park Church and meet your
K-2 student on the other side of Calvin Street. The amazing Mrs. Kitterman is happy to cross your
students. You'll avoid our small lot and the kids will have fun walking to the meet you. We are happy
to work to match your student with others crossing to create a small group who will walk together.
