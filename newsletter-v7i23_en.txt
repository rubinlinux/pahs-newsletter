==== Wondering about Weather? ====
If the district decides to make a change to the school schedule or bus routes
due to weather, it is communicated as quickly as possible in several ways, all
well before 6:30 a.m. If schools and buses are on their regular schedule,
there will NOT be an announcement.

==== Book Fair ====
The Book Fair has arrived. We'll have extended evening hours
on Monday from 6-8pm. We will not open the book fair
immediately after school on Monday. The Book Fair closes at
8:50 on Friday, March 9th.

==== Signing In ====
We're seeing an increase in folks signing in correctly each
morning. Thank you for that! Please remember that you must
also sign out each time you sign in. Please make sure that
you both check in and check out with the front office each
time you enter and exit the building. Thanks for your help in
letting us know who is in the building at all times!
