==== Pedestrian and Cyclist Safety Week is Here! ====
{{*crossingguard.png}}
This week Holt will be beginning our bicycle and pedestrian safety unit. All
PE classes will be learning about safe riding and walking practices. Please
join us in stressing the need for our children to wear bike helmets when
engaging in bicycling or rolling to school. This is both a critical and legal
issue near and dear to our hearts. We want all of your children to travel
safely and arrive home each day happy and healthy!

==== Walk & Bike to School Wednesday 4/11 ====

Wednesday is our next Walk & Bike to school event. We'll have great prizes for
all who participate. Make sure you swing by the Walk & Bike table to get your
chance to enter into our fabulous drawings. We gave away two helmets and two
gift cards last week to students who turned in their Walk, Bike & Roll logs.
Keep those coming in too!

==== Parent Board Meeting this Thursday 4/12 ====

Please join our Parent Board this Thursday in the library from 6:00-8:00pm.
Our Parent Board plans many our family events, our Jog-A-Thon, and heads up
our fundraising efforts. We enjoy your input and could really use your help.
The meetings are relaxed and we have fun. It's a great way to get to know
other parents and get more involved at the school. We always have one of our
administrators with us at these meetings. You can also grab a  few minutes
with Principal Joyce and ask any questions you might have. We hope to see you
there!
