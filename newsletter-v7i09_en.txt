{{*noschool.png}}
This week we will have school on Monday and Tuesday only. School is closed Wednesday and Thursday for conferences. Conference confirmations have been sent home. We're down to just 24 students in the building who are not yet scheduled for a conference. Thank you Melanie Schwarte for your hard work on this. Please call the Holt front office if you still need a conference. Our number is 541-790-6100.

==== Pictures ====
{{*pixday.gif}}
School pictures are distributed at conferences. We do not send them home due to the high number of pictures damaged in student backpacks. Pleas swing by the welcome desk at conferences either before or after your conference to pick up your pictures. Make-up pictures for anyone who missed the original day or for anyone not happy with their school pictures will be on Wednesday, November 29th.

==== School Fees ====
{{*school-supply.png}}
Each year Holt asks for $25 to cover all school supplies and fees for field trips. At present we have not received payment from approximately 50% of our families. We will be taking fees at the welcome table at conferences. If you need to make partial payment or work on a payment plan, one of our Administrators is happy to set that up for you. We accept cash or checks. Holt works hard to make your fees go a very long way. We use them to purchase pencils, binders, erasers, crayons, and countless other supplies. When we purchase in bulk we are able to get a far lower price than is available in stores. Please help us keep your costs down by turning in your school fees for the year. We gladly accept donations to cover a student who is not able to pay their fees.

==== Child Care Available During Conferences ====

We will have child care available in the Holt library during conferences. While we will try and accommodate younger children, we are not able to assist with babies. Stop by the welcome desk and we'll be happy to set up your child with an activity so you can have some individual time with your teacher. 

==== Help Prevent Illnesses ====
{{*sick.png}}
As the season changes toward winter, we tend to see an increase in illnesses. Please remember to keep 
children home from school until they have been free of fever, vomiting and diarrhea for a full 24 
hours. Help reduce the spread of illness and keep students home if they are sick.

Also, please remind your students to cover their coughs and wash their hands frequently to
reduce the spread of germs.
