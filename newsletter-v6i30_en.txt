{{*holtbolt.png}}
We have some very exciting news! I'm pleased to let you know we just crossed the $25,000 fundraising mark. We have now earned the Holt Skateworld Party (June 5th from 6-8pm) and the Inflatable/Mini Golf/Field Day with popcorn.

We are very close to reaching the final prize level ($35,000) where we will earn a Holt only Amazon Pool party. The deadline to reserve the pool is quickly approaching. 
If we can quickly raise the last $10,000 we will have an amazing Holt only evening at the pool. Please keep those pledges and donations coming, we're so close to meeting our goal!
